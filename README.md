# Vision Snake Game

A computer vision-powered implementation of the classic Snake game that utilizes real-time hand tracking via MediaPipe to enable gesture-based control. The application tracks the user's index finger position through webcam input and translates its coordinates to control the snake's movement in real-time.

## Technical Overview

The Vision Snake game implements a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Hand Tracking Module**: Utilizes MediaPipe Hands API for real-time hand landmark detection and tracking
- **Game Logic Module**: Implements the core snake game mechanics with collision detection and state management
- **Rendering Engine**: Handles all visual output including snake rendering, food visualization, and UI elements
- **Input Processing**: Converts detected hand landmarks into game control inputs

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Implements MediaPipe Hands API with a confidence threshold of 0.7 for reliable landmark detection
- **Adaptive Motion Control**: Dynamic snake movement system that follows index finger (landmark #8) coordinates with sub-pixel precision
- **Intelligent Collision Detection**: Two-phase collision detection algorithm that prioritizes food collision before self-collision to prevent false positives
- **Visual Feedback System**: 
  - Pulsating food indicators with concentric circles and "COLLECT" labels
  - Danger zone highlighting around snake body segments with semi-transparent overlays
  - Enhanced snake head visibility with contrasting outlines
  - Score-based snake color progression
- **Game State Management**: Comprehensive state management system with menu, playing, and pause states
- **Gesture Recognition**: Open palm detection for game reset using MediaPipe hand landmark configuration
- **Performance Optimization**: Frame rate management (~30 FPS) with adaptive update intervals based on score

## Installation

### Environment Setup

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages:

#### For standard Python venv (recommended)

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.7+
```

#### For Conda environments

```bash
# Create and activate a conda environment
conda create -n vision-snake python=3.9
conda activate vision-snake
```

### Installation Methods

#### Option 1: Development Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository with depth 1 for faster download
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/yourusername/vision-snake.git
cd vision-snake

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e .
```

#### Option 2: Dependencies-Only Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-snake.git
cd vision-snake

# Install runtime dependencies only
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 3: Apple Silicon-specific Installation

For M1/M2/M3 Mac users:

```bash
# Create Python 3.9+ environment (recommended for Apple Silicon)
python3 -m venv venv_py39
source venv_py39/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with specific versions compatible with Apple Silicon
pip install opencv-python==4.11.0.86 mediapipe==0.10.21 numpy==1.26.4

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Execution

### Command-Line Interface

After installation, the game can be executed through the provided CLI with various configuration options:

```bash
# Basic execution with default parameters
vision-snake

# Enable debug mode for verbose logging and performance metrics
vision-snake --debug

# Camera device selection (critical for systems with multiple video inputs)
vision-snake --camera 0  # Primary/built-in camera (default)
vision-snake --camera 1  # Secondary/external camera
vision-snake --camera 2  # Tertiary camera or virtual camera

# Combined parameters
vision-snake --camera 0 --debug  # Run with specific camera and debug output
```

### Direct Script Execution

Alternatively, execute the main script directly with Python interpreter:

```bash
# Standard execution
python src/main.py

# With command-line arguments
python src/main.py --camera 1 --debug
```

### System-Specific Notes

#### macOS Camera Permissions

On macOS, you must explicitly grant camera access permissions:

1. Navigate to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Camera
2. Ensure Terminal.app (or your Python IDE) has camera access enabled
3. For Continuity Camera users, use `--camera 1` to select iPhone/iPad camera

#### Windows Performance Optimization

On Windows systems, consider the following for optimal performance:

```bash
# Run with process priority adjustment (in PowerShell as Administrator)
Start-Process -FilePath "python" -ArgumentList "-m vision_snake" -WindowStyle Normal -Priority High
```

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Control System

1. **Initial Setup**: Position yourself approximately 0.5-1.0 meters from the webcam in well-lit conditions
2. **Hand Detection**: Raise your hand with palm facing the camera until hand landmarks are detected
3. **Movement Control**: Extend your index finger to control the snake's head position
   - The snake head follows the (x, y) coordinates of your index fingertip (MediaPipe landmark #8)
   - Movement speed adapts dynamically based on score progression

### Game Elements

1. **Snake Representation**:
   - Head: Larger circle with white outline for visibility
   - Body: Series of connected circles with score-based color progression
   - Danger zones: Semi-transparent red indicators around body segments

2. **Food Collection**:
   - Food items appear as red circles with pulsating visual effects
   - Concentric circles and "COLLECT" label indicate collectible items
   - Collection increases score and snake length by 5 segments
   - Food placement uses a pseudo-random algorithm avoiding snake body

3. **Collision Detection**:
   - Two-phase detection prioritizes food collision before self-collision
   - Threshold-based proximity detection with 10-pixel collision radius
   - Self-collision only checked after minimum snake length (6 segments)

4. **Game State Management**:
   - Game Over: Triggered by self-collision
   - Reset: Show open palm gesture (all 5 fingers extended) for 2 seconds
   - Exit: Press 'q' or ESC key
